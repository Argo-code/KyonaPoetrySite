Spoons:
Times a foot, running and running, unstoppable and [[Free]]

I must be quick, I must hurry, for my ice cream is dying. 

I grip the drawers and yank with my might, searching and searching for that blasted thing. 

No, no, NO NO NO. I search and search, but there is none to find. 

My poor ice cream dying beside.
