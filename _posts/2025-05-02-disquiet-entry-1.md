[[Disquiet Entries]]

When the streets are lit, the stars bright, and the moon reflecting the dreams of the day, only I am awake. Not in the literal sense, Ive never been truly awake, but in the strange metaphorical sense, a sense of melodramatic thought, of quiet hope, of violent disgust, and an all encompassing dread. I walk a lonely street, the shadows jump, dance, and twirl--Creating faint images of the past and future. I am tied to this burning, acidic future--Clutched in my petrified hand--I cannot wake.
