Praise:
I was called a smart guy, 
a nice guy, 
a happy guy. 

Someone with gifts, 
someone with hope. 

it burns, aches, stabs, and yanks.
to hear compliments a stab to the heart, 
an insult to the mind. 

I yearn for compliments--
yet how can I ask for support, 
while balking at that very sort?

The target of my desires, 
the most potent blade,
made with purest intent. 

I bleed and cry,
each time I hear that wretched phrase
"What a smart guy"
