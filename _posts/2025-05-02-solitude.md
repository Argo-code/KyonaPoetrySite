Solitude—

A grievous word,
A dirty word,
A loaded word.

Peace in solitude—
A lonely phrase,
A beautiful phrase,
A necessary phrase.

To wish for peace without solitude
Is not to ask for the possible,
But to ask for the unreachable.

An impossible task: to find peace without quiet.
Impossibly hard to find,
Impossibly hard to define,
Impossibly hard to imagine.
  
Peace requires solitude.
Does this make peace dirty?
Something to avoid?
Something to disrespect?
Nay.

Solitude brings to light—
The ghosts,
The devils,
The shadow of the soul.

How can we know peace--
Find peace--
If we don’t know what
Haunts our hearts and minds?

Solitude—
A forsaken word,
A beautiful word,
A necessary word.
