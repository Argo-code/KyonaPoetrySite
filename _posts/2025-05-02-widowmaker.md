Widowmaker my beloved
Trapped and caged,
Twisted without reason.

A life of Ballet trampled,
the freedom of flight. 
Chained, and twisted.

A monster born anew, 
Caught in the web of lies,
she weaves her new song.

A huntress being hunted by the past,
a dancer without love,
a spider with a web but no silk.
