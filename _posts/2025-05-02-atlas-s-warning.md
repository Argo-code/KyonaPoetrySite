Atlas's Warning:

Why, whY, wHY, WHY.

Once I asked why, my impossible, eternal journey began.  
Each why, a step.  
Each how, another.  
Each what, a laggard sigh.  
Up the opalescent palace steps.

How did?  
Why is there?  
What now?  
My questions—a key to open the gate.

Beyond, only a man holding the endless sky.  
I ask Atlas, "Why do you hold the weight of the sky?"  
He looks down, solemn and tired:  
"I hold it because one must."

"What does it feel like?"  
"Why don't you feel it for yourself?" he offers.

An answer? Is that possible?  
A single, true answer among the thousands of why’s?  
I step beneath the sky.

Crushing, infinite weight—eternally heavy.  
Struggling, I ask for the sky's truth,  
and it answers, not with words, but with silence.

Its silence so vast, it encompasses the heavens,  
its volume immeasurable—both infinite and deafening.

Collapsing under the weight,  
Atlas once again takes his preordained vigil,  
a position only bearable by the might of a titan.

Holding the sky, he says,  
"Only those destined with strength beyond measure can hold the sky."

I crumble before him,  
the burden of the answer heavier than the sky itself.

Woe to me! Woe to any who dare seek the answer to 'why!'  
The weight of the answers, the non-answers,  
and their consequences—so obvious, now.

Now, I bear the eternal burden of knowledge;  
knowing why we fear 'why.'
