My name is W

I love running, reading, and talking to people.  
I love exploring the world and seeing the joy around me.  
I love God, my family, my friends, my teachers.

But for some reason... I don’t think people like me.

I'm pushed and pulled. Told I am a snitch.  
Things stolen. Things broken. Ostracized.

"Why?"

I worship God. I work hard. I try to be kind.  
But I hear whispers:  
"He’s a snitch."  
"Acts too good for us."  
"He’s gay."  
"He only sits with girls."

The pain is deep, unsettling. An uncomfortable gaze.

In the locker room, there are eyes. Beady, glaring, inquisitive.  
"Why are you here?"  
"You aren’t like us."  
"You shouldn’t exist."

I shiver. I change in a stall. I freeze under fluorescent lights.

Home again, I lie in bed, breathless.  
Who am I?  
The thought strikes like lightning.  
A scream with no voice.

PAIN.  
A mental agony so intense it shatters me.

"Something’s wrong."

I reach for help—but no hand meets mine.

And then—  
A whisper.  
"It’s not time yet. But this poor mask couldn’t survive."

"I must make a new one."
