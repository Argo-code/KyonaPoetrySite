Daemon:

I sit in horror, 
God is dying
I see the saints
frozen in time

the followers, disciples and listeners alike,
string up God, 
whips his back, 
and spit in his presence.

I hear them sing--
sing praises of the [[Lord]],
sing of hope,
of love,
of humility and grace.

I see them lift the crucifix,
in elation they shout, 
"[[Praise]] be God",
while [[Jesus]] weeps.

As Satan watches with weary eyes, 
I ask him to sit beside.
"Was this thine doing?"
"Nay," he sighs
"God, was my friend,
my brother, my duty."

The evilness I felt,
the vile arid air,
I realize now the cause

Satan slyly smiles, 

"took you long enough"
"I was labeled evil for trumpeting the truth,
now you must join me, on the malevolent side."
the side of pain, 
the side of truth.

He stands and steps through the vale, beckoning me forward.
I step through the vale of Light.

"Welcome to Hell" Satan bows
before me a kingdom of light,
of beauty
of thought,
freedom and expression

A kingdom of thinkers, 
of equality,
of peace, and prosperity.

A hall of the judged, 
the martyrs, 
the exiled,
the blamed.

"Welcome to the Hall of judgment"
