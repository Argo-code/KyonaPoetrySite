What dark clouds, 

crushing thunder, 

crashing bolts of lightning--

Trumpeting the arrival of rain.

<br>
Winds blowing along the streets, 

Shaking the windows, 

Whistling through the apartment walls. 

The sun covered, cloaked, hidden from glory 

<br>
Such joyous weather is it not?

<br>
The colorful leaves, the beautiful flowers, the saturated green grass.

Worms drowning,

birds tweeting, 

bees and wasps a-flight.

<br>
What a strange feeling, the calm after the storm.

to feel peace in the remains of chaos,

awe in spite of crushed branches--

joy in flooded lots. 

<br>
A rainbow hovering in the sky

an apology for the spiteful storm.
