A Mosaic Thesis:

Shunned, and scorned
Cut, and crossed.
Forgotten, and demonized. 
the poor soul journeys alone.

Fear not, 
for this soul holds no anger,
no vengeance.
this child walks with the light 
a mosaic peace.

What is joy,
without a tinge of sorrow,
inner peace.
without contradiction 
stability,
without turmoil.

Fear not for their life,
they feel peace, 
and joy,
comfort, and warmth. 

they sit alone,
yet do not feel lonely,
they sit in the dark, 
but do not see the devil,

the light may flicker, 
as a flame cupped in trembling hands.
but fear not, 
their light cannot be extinguished. 

Hope, 
A strange thing,
an elusive thing,
the elusive treasure--
hope--
found in the crumbling temple.

A treasure, a jewel,
a boon of wisdom, 
found--
in the treasure chest.
