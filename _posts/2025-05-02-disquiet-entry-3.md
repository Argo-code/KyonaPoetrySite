[[Disquiet Entries]]

Masked, hidden, undefined—I exist only where one cannot. Born into a world of labels, defined before I could speak, I have only ever been a witness to labeling. Can one truly exist, if existence is always named first? I walk the streets of a city I do not belong to. A night so dim, I rely on street lamps—Lights that seem to reveal everything and yet define nothing. How can they touch the world, yet leave it uncarved? Perhaps I am that space—Not the light, not the shadow, but the gap between them. The ghost of something that should have been real. Can I live in the present, If I am only a shard— A splinter of the mirror that broke before I was born?
