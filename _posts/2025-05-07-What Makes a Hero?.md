An epistolary 
**Dear Hero,**

Tell me—
what makes a hero?

By definition, perhaps: a savior.
A slayer of evil. A symbol.
Someone who vanquishes monsters,
wields Excalibur,
bears the ring,
walks the path of righteousness.

But I disagree.

A hero, to me, is someone who knows their limits.
Someone who shouts into the void,
not in defiance—
but in a call for help.
Someone who speaks
before they falter;
one who recognizes the futility of selfish solitude,
who asks for a shield,
a friend,
a saint.

How can one fight a hydra
without someone to swing the blade,
or a torch to cauterize the wounds?

How does a hero know the weakness of the beast,
if not through the sage’s guidance,
the scout’s reports,
the mage’s divinations?

It is not a single soul that makes a hero—
but those who surround them.
Those who lift them up.
The one who is humble enough,
brave enough,
to say:
I alone am not enough.
That is the true hero.

Individual though they may be,
it is the asking that marks the difference
between hero and soldier.
A soldier fights because they are told—
perhaps even because they choose to—
but they are forgotten,
folded into the count,
reduced to a number.

Your valor is mythical.
Mystical. Divine.
To struggle is human.
To run is human.
But to recognize your limits—
that is divine.

To seize your story,
to write your own lines,
to be both page and pen,
keeper and author—
that is heroism.

Struggling is human.
Struggling with someone?
That is heroic.

I am in awe of your strength,
your wisdom,
your fortitude.

Carry on, my hero.
