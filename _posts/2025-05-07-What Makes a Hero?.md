An epistolary
<br>

Dear Hero,

Tell me—
what makes a hero?
<br>

By definition, perhaps: a savior.

A slayer of evil. A symbol.

Someone who vanquishes monsters,

wields Excalibur,

bears the ring,

walks the path of righteousness.


<br>

But I disagree.


<br>
A hero, to me, is someone who knows their limits.

Someone who shouts into the void,

not in defiance—

but in a call for help.

Someone who speaks

before they falter;

one who recognizes the futility of selfish solitude,

who asks for a shield,

a friend,

a saint.



<br>
How can one fight a hydra

without someone to swing the blade,

or a torch to cauterize the wounds?



<br>
How does a hero know the weakness of the beast,

if not through the sage’s guidance,

the scout’s reports,

the mage’s divinations?



<br>
It is not a single soul that makes a hero—

but those who surround them.

Those who lift them up.

The one who is humble enough,

brave enough,

to say:

I alone am not enough.

That is the true hero.



<br>
Individual though they may be,

it is the asking that marks the difference

between hero and soldier.

A soldier fights because they are told—

perhaps even because they choose to—

but they are forgotten,

folded into the count,

reduced to a number.



<br>
Your valor is mythical.

Mystical. Divine.

To struggle is human.

To run is human.

But to recognize your limits—

that is divine.


<br>
To seize your story,

to write your own lines,

to be both page and pen,

keeper and author—

that is heroism.


<br>
Struggling is human.

Struggling with someone?

That is heroic.



<br>
I am in awe of your strength,

your wisdom,

your fortitude.

<br>
Carry on, my hero.
