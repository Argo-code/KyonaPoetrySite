[[Disquiet Entries]]

Reality is just an illusion, and illusions are simply reality with the edges blurred. So what, then, is reality? Is it mine? Yours? The shadow’s? The crowd’s? No—none of that. Reality is my illusion, and mine alone. I will shape it, corral it, sculpt it like sand that dares to slip through my fingers. My reality is sovereign, unshakable, and yet it trembles—trembles with fear, with memory, with the pressure of having been seen. I am God in a world only I inhabit, and still, it shivers when I speak. Is this not reality at its truest? Something both made and unmade, ruled and unruly, sacred and collapsing? A truth I control, but never truly command.
