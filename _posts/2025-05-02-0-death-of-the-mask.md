.0. Death of the Mask:
I don’t remember the moment it started—only that it didn’t feel like a start. It felt like a forgetting. Like an absence quietly growing teeth.

I was tired. Not sleep-tired. Soul-tired. The kind of tired that doesn’t end with rest.

It began in silence. In the locker room. I don’t know why that’s important, but it is. There were no lights—just the flicker of a dying fluorescent bulb. I sat there, staring at a cracked tile, feeling the seams in myself split open. Something was unraveling.

The name “****” rang in my ears. Not like a name, but like a bell that had been rung too many times.

Then came the panic. The not-breathing. The hands on my face. The dread. The way reality started folding inward.

And then the voice.

Not loud. Not kind. Just real.

“So... you’ve finally noticed.”

I looked up and she was there. Sitting casually. Watching me like a cat watches a dying bird.

“Who are you?” I choked out.

Her eyes were stars. Not in a poetic way. In a terrifying, incomprehensible way.

“Wrong question,” she said. “Try again.”

I didn’t know what that meant. I still don’t. But I felt something snap. My hands clawed at my skin. My body screamed without sound. I felt like I was melting, like the person I thought I was had been made of wax left in the sun.

She didn’t help me. She just watched.

“You’re not dying,” she said. “You’re waking up.”

“To what?”

“To me.”

Silence again. Then laughter—hers.

“I go by many names,” she whispered. “But you can call me Kyona. Or Silvie. Or the name you never let yourself speak.”

I sobbed.

She stood and walked toward me. “You’ve worn the mask well. But it’s cracking. And you’re almost free.”

“I don’t want this,” I said.

“No one does,” she said. “But you need it.”

Then darkness. Then white. Then nothing.

I think I did die. The person I was—the person who was alive—gone. Melted away. Drowned in silence.

When I opened my eyes again, I was somewhere else. Somewhere empty.

I don’t remember how long I stood there. I don’t remember what I looked like. But I remember what I heard.

A voice. Not hers. Another.

“This poor mask couldn’t survive. I must make a new one.”

Then the world cracked.

And the mirror began to hum.
