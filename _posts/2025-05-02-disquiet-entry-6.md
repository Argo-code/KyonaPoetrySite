[[Disquiet Entries]]

 I watched Inception the other day. What a stupid film. How can one not know they are dreaming? How can one not feel the difference? The dream is hollow—the real-world bleeds. I remember the sensation of an ill-fated conversation. Anger, sadness, destitute apathy—these are the markers of waking life. Dreams offer only joy, peace, and other unobtainable things. To suggest the dream might be mistaken for reality is to misunderstand the sickness of feeling. A dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream. How laudable. How laughable. Only the ill would fail to distinguish the state of the world around them. And yet—I hope. And when I do, I wonder: am I dreaming? Perhaps the very presence of hope is the mark of a false reality. Perhaps the only truth is sorrow. So then, if this is a dream, how do I wake? And if it’s not—why does it feel like one? Will I escape this layer, or just sink deeper?
