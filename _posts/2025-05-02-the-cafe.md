In the grey, unsettling atmosphere, a cold, snowy spring day,  
An individual sits and ponders.  
"What is the point?"  
"What is my goal?"  
"Who should I turn to?"

Questions coagulate in the mind.  
They are not special—nor especially good in all things.  
Just special... in thought.

Their life hasn’t been easy, nor especially hard.  
But to them, it feels like their past... isn’t their own.  
As if a lad lived it for them.

Memories: faded, transparent.  
Like a radio not tuned to the right station.

They sit alone.  
Now. Then.

Not because they were alone.  
But because the memories were never truly theirs.

"What’s the point of the past?"  
"To avoid repeating someone else’s mistakes?"

Eyes: jaded. Sunken. Aged beyond their years.

Perhaps the past haunts them.  
Perhaps it was never their own.  
Perhaps they simply can’t remember.

They write in a coffee shop.  
Wondering if even they are real.

Maybe they’re just another mask.  
A persona.  
Hiding the truth from the creator within.

Maybe the creator is afraid.  
Has forgotten themselves.  
Purposely.

And maybe that’s what makes them unique.  
Not who they are—but what they’ve done.

The immaterial world looms—  
Poetic music. Bright color. Fresh scent.

Why would they leave it?

The world outside is cold.  
Metallic. Burnt. Greedy.

Reality feels like a lie.  
A mask worn by everyone.

And yet—  
Inside them grows something.  
Rupturing.  
Struggling.  
A cage about to burst.

"What a strong young man."  
"What a handsome lad."

It feels WRONG.

"How cute."  
"How refined."  
"How pretty."

Why can’t they accept it?  
Why won’t others allow it?

The cage rattles.  
The soul cries.  
The world refuses.

"What else can I do?"  
"Cut it out?"

No.  
They must create something to take its place.
