Dear Morpheus:

Dear Morpheus, 

I seem to recall a dream from eons ago, 
but I must have misplaced it. 
I remember a dream of making the wrong choice--
inevitably causing pain and grief.

I wish to ask, 
do you remember giving me that dream?
If not, I fear I forged it myself--
cast it from the lies and truth, 
wrapped it in silence and called it "hope". 

Either way Mr. Morpheus, 
I keep startling awake--
please if you see it, let me take a break, 
I rest not when forced to reckon with that immoral thing.
