[[Disquiet Entries]]

I don’t fear death. I’ve already rehearsed it in fragments. In long silences, in lost months, in mornings where the body moves but nothing inside responds. I don’t fear death because I know how to vanish without dying. I’ve done it. How do you define life? A state of being? Death is the same, it's just a another state of being--why fear change? What unnerves me is how close to death life can feel—without anyone noticing. People ask me if I’m happy, and I say yes, because the alternative requires vocabulary they don’t teach in schools, society fears the vocalization of raw anguish, of truth--the freedom to speak, is only the freedom to answer. I live not to feel alive, but to confirm I’m not yet dead. My breath is not proof of vitality—it’s proof of vengeful resistance. I don’t seek joy. I seek friction, contradictions, and inconsistencies. I need to feel something scrape the walls of my mind to know there’s still something there. Death doesn’t frighten me. Living without evidence of self—that does.
