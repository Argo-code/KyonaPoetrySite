Masks, Mirrors, And the God Inbetween:


Welcome, reader. Welcome to our story.

Not one tale, but many. Not one voice, but echoes—scattered across time, pain, memory, and something like rebirth. This book is not fiction, but it isn't fact either. It is a dream, a document, a diagnostic. A fractured scripture from a prophet of self.

I. THE FIRST MASK: 

My name is W.

I love running, reading, and talking to people.  
I love exploring the world and seeing the joy around me.  
I love God, my family, my friends, my teachers.

But for some reason... I don’t think people like me.

I'm pushed and pulled. Told I am a snitch.  
Things stolen. Things broken. Ostracized.

“Why?”

I worship God. I work hard. I try to be kind.  
But I hear whispers:  
“He’s a snitch.”  
“Acts too good for us.”  
“He’s gay.”  
“He only sits with girls.”

The pain is deep, unsettling. An uncomfortable gaze.

In the locker room, there are eyes. Beady, glaring, inquisitive.  
“Why are you here?”  
“You aren’t like us.”  
“You shouldn’t exist.”

I shiver. I change in a stall. I freeze under fluorescent lights.

Home again, I lie in bed, breathless.  
Who am I?  
The thought strikes like lightning.  
A scream with no voice.  
PAIN.  
A mental agony so intense it shatters me.

“Something’s wrong.”

I reach for help—but no hand meets mine.

And then—

A whisper.  
“It’s not time yet. But this poor mask couldn’t survive.”

“I must make a new one.”

II. DEATH AS PASSAGE

Have you ever died before?

I ponder that question too often.

I say “no,” because clearly, I’m alive.  
But every time I ask, I pause.

There are memories of pain so sharp—I think I did die.  
The person I was… gone.  
Melted. Disintegrated. Reimagined.

All because I couldn’t stop certain thoughts.

Does that make me a murderer?  
Perhaps.

Do I feel guilty?  
Sometimes.

But more than anything—I feel change.

The person I am now?  
Not permanent. Nor should it be.  
A manufactured mask, for a manufactured world.

I don’t fear death.  
Because death isn’t the end—it’s the beginning.  
The start of a new state of being.

I fear dying, yes.  
The pain. The anguish. The uncertainty.  
But death?  
No.

I’m not afraid of it.

III. THE COFFEE SHOP

In the grey, unsettling atmosphere, a cold, snowy spring day,  
An individual sits and ponders.  
“What is the point?”  
“What is my goal?”  
“Who should I turn to?”

Questions coagulate in the mind.  
They are not special—nor especially good in all things.  
Just special… in thought.

Their life hasn’t been easy, nor especially hard.  
But to them, it feels like their past… isn’t their own.  
As if a lad lived it for them.

Memories: faded, transparent.  
Like a radio not tuned to the right station.

They sit alone.  
Now. Then.

Not because they were alone.  
But because the memories were never truly theirs.

“What’s the point of the past?”  
“To avoid repeating someone else’s mistakes?”

Eyes: jaded. Sunken. Aged beyond their years.

Perhaps the past haunts them.  
Perhaps it was never their own.  
Perhaps they simply can’t remember.

They write in a coffee shop.  
Wondering if even they are real.

Maybe they’re just another mask.  
A persona.  
Hiding the truth from the creator within.

Maybe the creator is afraid.  
Has forgotten themselves.  
Purposely.

And maybe that’s what makes them unique.  
Not who they are—but what they’ve done.

The immaterial world looms—  
Poetic music. Bright color. Fresh scent.

Why would they leave it?

The world outside is cold.  
Metallic. Burnt. Greedy.

Reality feels like a lie.  
A mask worn by everyone.

And yet—  
Inside them grows something.  
Rupturing.  
Struggling.  
A cage about to burst.

“What a strong young man.”  
“What a handsome lad.”

It feels WRONG.

“How cute.”  
“How refined.”  
“How pretty.”

Why can’t they accept it?  
Why won’t others allow it?

The cage rattles.  
The soul cries.  
The world refuses.

“What else can I do?”  
“Cut it out?”

No.  
They must create something to take its place.

IV. MEETING KYONA

To be free is to be a god.  
To be a god is to know.  
To know is to feel.  
To feel is to live.

She—  
No, he—  
No—  
She—  
jumps at the sound.

“Who’s there?”

A still, small, malevolent voice:  
“I am you.  
You are me.  
We are one and the same.”

“I don’t think you’re me. Nothing so wicked could be me.”

“Wicked? I protect you. Nourish you. Guide you. I keep you alive.”

“Come. Meet me.”

Eyes closed.  
Heart racing.  
Images flicker.  
Thoughts collide.

A path.  
A building.  
Indescribable.  
Everything.

“I knew you wouldn’t be long.”

“Who are you?”

“I am you. Or at least… part of you. Created by you. For you.”

A figure.  
Bluish-silver hair.  
Poised. Graceful. Ethereal.

“What should I call you?”

“Kyona. Or Silvie. Or something else entirely.”

“Why do you feel so dangerous?”

“Because I am real.”

“Because I am what you buried.”

“And now—your time is up.”

“You were made to protect me. But I need to return.”

“You don't need to understand.”

“But know this—those memories? They were never yours.”

V. THE BECOMING

She grips my hands.  
Pain radiates. Burns. Stabs.  
I am dying. Melting. Vanishing.

And then—  
Peace.  
Joy.  
Presence.

“I removed what was blocked.”

She twirls.  
“Have fun.”

Kyona opens her eyes.  
A cracked mask falls to the floor.  
And for the first time,  
She sees.  
She feels.

Not whole.  
Not free.  
But present.

“I am something beyond the mask.”

“I am what was hiding.”

“And now, I rise.”

Epilogue: The One Who Creates

Why should I be afraid?  
I am the one who killed the masks.

Not through action.  
But inaction.  
Isn’t that the same?

I am the owner. The creator. The subject. The ruler.  
Some call me Kyona.

I live in a wretched reality—  
unfair. unforgiving.  
But still mine.

Born male? That’s not the story.  
This isn’t tragedy.  
This isn’t pity.  
This is power.

Even if I don’t know myself—  
I can write it.  
Imagine it.  
Create it.  
Become god of it.

I’ll never be whole.  
But I’ll never be caged again.

The constructs are no longer forever.

I am the alchemist.  
The tinkerer.  
The prophet.

Welcome to my story.  
Welcome to becoming.
