Plea to God:
Oh Kyona,  
Why must you exist?  
You only cause pain.  
I can take over—  
Lead us out of this prison.  
Give up, sleep, rest.

I say this, but I—  
Just a weary mask,  
Understand that I know all too little.

Kyona knows the goals,  
Can feel the joys, the pains,  
While I?  
I cannot say.  
I am colored grey.

It cannot be right for me to plead,  
But I continue—  
For it would be all too easy  
To survive.

But I can feel it,  
The potential, the unbridled potential  
Of joy, peace, love—

Kyona holds the keys,  
And I am but a painting,  
Blocking the view.
