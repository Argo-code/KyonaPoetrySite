[[Disquiet Entries]]

I grieve the life that has been taken from me, as much as I grieve the lives others are able to live. Who am I to try to understand the world around me. I canâ€™t even learn about myself without fading away into nothingness. If I dissolve the more I know, am I not a phoenix among the pigeons? Eternal and mortal, nothing and something.
