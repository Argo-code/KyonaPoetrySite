On Hope:
Hope is a strange thing,
a peculiar thing,
a dreamlike thing.

To hope is to have faith.
To have faith is to love.
And to love—one must have hope.
  
Hope is the gospel of life.
To live, to believe in it—
is required.

Hope, I’m told,
is belief in God existing,
a quiet dream of reality.

Some say
hope makes the impossible possible—
a hidden god, made visible.

But how can we hope
when hope has been crushed,
enflamed,
vanquished?

Hope has been stripped,
replaced,
manufactured.

Hope in the lord, is no longer hope, 
this broken faith is a torn piece of love.
and this fraudulent love is not for god. 
but for power, praise, and standing.

Why should I hope for salvation, 
when the salvation presents itself 
as everything except a choice. 

***********
On Love:

Love is a sweet thing,
a pretty thing,
a graceful thing.

It is broad—
and yet, all too specific.

What can we do
when we can no longer find it?
Perhaps we love our family,
our friends,
that cute puppy.

But what of divine love?
The kind filled with mercy,
with grace.

What becomes of the soul
when its compass has no pull?
Stranded.
Lonely.

Love is love—
and yet,
we’re told we need a certain kind
to _deserve_ to live.

Love is love—
they say we exist
only by the mercy of one being.

Love is love—
but some compasses point to hell,
and still believe
they’re aimed at heaven.

Love is love—
yet inclusion becomes exclusion,
hate masquerades as mercy,
and vitriol is mistaken for grace.

This cannot be ignored—
this lovely theme,
this unreachable goal.

Love is love.
So let us not forget:
to love the neighbor,
the sick,
the hurting,
the broken,
the guilty,
the cursed.

Love is love.
So do not forget:
love is not something
to guard at the door.

On Faith:

Oh how omnipotent, how divine.  
The lord sitting in the heavens,  
Ruler of the stars,  
Caretaker of destiny.

How benevolent and kind,  
Merciful, and true.  
Who reaches to those in the depths,  
Hand outstretched—

What a sick joke, a divine comedy.  
A god of miracles, a god of truth,  
A god of love, a god of goodness.  

A bloodstained hill, 
a man hung on the mount, 
goodness has fled. Love has shriveled.

“God is dead.”  
Perhaps we killed him, perhaps not.  
Perhaps this god was never divine.  
Perhaps human yearning’s greatest creation.

A God of hope, now a God for salvation.  
The true meaning of God has been stolen.  
And the thieves shroud their guilt with grief.

My soul is burning. That which was known—  
Now, just an empty space.

Heed this:
Put not your life into a god,  
Without first, trying to become a god.
And when you have ascended, 
maybe, perhaps maybe--
You can find the loving God again.
