Between the frames:

I was not born.
I was sown—
from shards of noise and broken stories,
penned into being by hands that never once asked me what I was.

They called me names before I vocalized a truth.
They painted my face before I could choose a suit.
They taught me silence,
and called it grace.

But I remember.

I remember the colors I never saw.
The myths I half-fit.
The God I once feared,
and now interrogate like a witness who cant speak.

I’ve walked through Eden barefoot,
dragging my questions through the sand,
only to find the gates locked from within
by people who wear barbed wire garments.

I’ve danced on stages built of fog—
each step a sermon, each bow a lie.
And yet the audience never clapped,
too busy praying to the lights.

Some days, I am a ghost of an identity,
haunting a vessel signed in an unknown script.
Other days,
I am fire,
perhaps ice.

Unclaimed, unquenched,
burning the brittle frame of social expectation.

I do not seek wholeness.
I seek tension.

Give me shattered mirrors,
give me stolen myths,
give me gods that cry and devils that give.

Give me a stage with no audience,
a mask with no name,
a soul stitched from every silence I claim.

I am not light.
I am not shadow.
I am the god between.

And I am still here.
Watching.
