Haze:
what is this haze, 
a fog of the mind,
a misty window of the soul, 
a fatigue of sunless life--
in the sunlit day.

 _I sleep awake._
_I rustle at midnight._
 _I dream of wakingâ€”_
_of sunlight on the forest floor._

the fog rolling, twisting, evolving.
blocks, traps, and constrains,
where is my light?
my rest?
my will to move
my energy to speak. 

The fog, a predator--
fangs in my neck, draining life. 
the overcast, an endless night.

alas, be happy the onlookers shout,
be happy and you will wake!

they don't understand, I am happy, blissful even,
I am satisfied, peculiarly enlightened perhaps. 

this is not fog of despair--no, 
it's more malevolent, more wretched.
A villain without reason, 
a wound without a weapon.
