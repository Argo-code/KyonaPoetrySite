Freely Chained:

Ah, I must be a mask, a dream, a farce.  
Even knowing this horrid truth,  
I still would rather dream.

Dream of where I am real,  
my soul bleeding into the unconscious sea.

Where do I begin? Where do I end?  
A bittersweet delight to know,  
no matter what I accomplish—it won’t matter,  
how little I accomplish—similarly matters little.

I am free, freely chained.
