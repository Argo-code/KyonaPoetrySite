A Thought Exercise: 

A thought exercise;

When one experiences an emotion,

When it becomes normal,

Are they feeling that emotion?

if one is happy all the time, are they actually happy?

 Rather then just lacking sadness?

what does it mean, when depression, sadness, anxiety—

Fear, repression, horror,

What does it mean,

when those are the norm.

 I am not sad, angry, hurt,

But, why do I feel so crushed am I lacking the opposite of sadness?

 The unflowering lotus?

The frozen seed?

the unborn soul?

We can never know.
