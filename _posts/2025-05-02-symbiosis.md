Symbiosis:
A sightless thing,
A soundless thing,
An indescribable thing

It claws at my mind, 
it grasps my heart,
crushes my lungs,

persistent, and unavoidable,
this criminal fate,
and yet, easily explained away.

All encompassing,
enshrined in my mind,
lurking in a shattered temple. 

This claustrophobic feeling,
A drowning feeling, 
A free falling feeling.

it grips my soul, 
chains my life,
disrupts my voice.

Such a conscious thing,
Such a audible thing, 
such a describable thing 

A prison of thought,
A judge of intent,
A executioner of action.

This wretched parasite,
A symbiotic state.
I cannot escape this fate.
