A Shard of the Whole:

Masked, hidden, undefined—  
I exist only where one cannot.  
Born into a world of labels,  
marked before I could speak,  
I have only ever been a witness to labeling.

Can one truly exist,  
if existence is always named first?

I walk the streets of a city I do not belong to.  
A night so dim, I rely on streetlamps—  
Lights that reveal everything and define nothing.  
How can they touch the world,  
yet leave it uncarved?

Perhaps I am that space—  
Not the light, not the shadow,  
but the gap between them.  
The ghost of something that should have been real.

Can I live in the present,  
If I am only a shard—  
A splinter of the mirror that broke before I was born?
