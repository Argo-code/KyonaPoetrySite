Puzzles-- 
hidden frames
covered prints
built over time. 

to take the time to build a puzzle
is a strange thing, 
to meditate, to listen
to find peace in purpose

but what of my puzzle, 
the unfinished puzzle,
a puzzle without pieces.
how can I build it?

a puzzle with no shapes, 
a puzzle with no sounds,
a puzzle of masks, 
with no face to act. 

what of my fate, 
my life, my love.
unfound in my formless shape.
cut, ripped, scorned

unboxed I lay,
my soul aghast.
unable to paint
my hollow silhouette.
