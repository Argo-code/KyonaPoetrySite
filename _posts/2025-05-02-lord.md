Lord:
Lord, I ask thee--
Help me understand.
why must I live this life.

Lord, I beg thee--
Tell me why I must live
life as a ghost.

Lord, I haven't forsaken thee--
I pray, read the scriptures, and follow the script
oh lord, why must it be so.

Lord, I ask thee.
Lord, I beg thee.
Lord, I haven't forsaken thee.
Lord, please don't ignore me.
