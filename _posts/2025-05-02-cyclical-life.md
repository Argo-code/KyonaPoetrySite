Cyclical Life:

A thousand lifetimes—
why must I feel I lived through the original dawn?
Tiredness besets my soul.

I feel the human experience, the collective memories—
the archetypes of life. I see them. I feel them,
deeper than the depths of culture.

The memories of life itself plague my mind:
the tribal love of fire, the vows of knights,
the pledging to power.

Still, I hear it ringing—
bells, the booming beat of the eternal bells.
Where is my rest, my space of respite?
I can’t go on.

I am no Atlas.
But as forsaken a duty as this is,
I will look onward, holding the sky—

so the world can move on:
destroying,
forgetting,
leaving me in the ash.
