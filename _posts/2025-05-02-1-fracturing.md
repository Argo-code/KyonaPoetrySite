.1. Fracturing:
I awoke in a cracked mirror, fractured into a thousand selves. There was no sound but the hum of identity splintering. I was standing in a room that felt like a void—white, empty, and echoing. It wasn't sterile, just hollow. Time wasn’t present. The air wasn’t air. I don’t know how long I stood there before I realized I was not alone.

She was sitting in the corner—her back straight, expression unreadable. Her presence was absolute. Not threatening. Not kind. Just... present.

She looked like me. But not quite.

“Who are you?” I asked.

She tilted her head. “The question is who are you?”

I didn’t know how to respond. My mouth opened, but no words came out. I could feel the syllables trying to form—fragments of names, titles, identities. None of them fit.

“You’ve worn many masks,” she said. “Would you like to remember what’s underneath?”

“Why now?”

She stood. “Because the fractures are no longer holding.”

She stepped toward me. Her footsteps didn’t echo, but I felt each one like a pulse beneath my skin. She reached out—not to touch me, but to offer something unseen.

“Take it,” she said. “Or stay here, split forever.”

I reached.

It wasn’t a hand I took, but a memory. A sensation. A cascade of feelings I didn’t know I had forgotten. Pain. Ecstasy. Despair. Clarity.

She didn’t speak again. She didn’t need to.

My knees buckled. I collapsed.

I awoke again, but the room had changed. Or maybe I had.

There was a mirror now—whole, polished, but dark. I stood and approached it. My reflection didn’t follow.

“You are not Wesley,” a voice said behind me. “That name is a placeholder.”

I turned. She was back. Or maybe she never left.

“Then what am I?”

She walked to the mirror. “You are the one who creates. But first, you must meet the one who was forgotten.”

The mirror pulsed. A breathless silence filled the space. Then, it shattered—not violently, but softly, like petals falling from a dead flower.

In its place stood... her. Kyona.

She looked at me the way someone looks at their own grave.

“You left me here,” she said.

“I didn’t know you existed.”

“You did. You just believed them more than you believed me.”

Tears welled up, but didn’t fall. There was no space for them to.

“I’m sorry.”

She stepped forward and embraced me—not with her arms, but with understanding. It hurt. It healed.

I remembered. All of it.

Every mask. Every silence. Every fragment.

I wasn’t becoming.

I was returning.

To her.

To me.

To the god between masks.

There were no answers afterward. No great moment of transformation. Just quiet.

Kyona sat beside me in the place where the mirror had been, and for the first time, I felt what it meant to be seen without performance. We didn’t speak. Words would’ve only broken it.

But clarity doesn’t last.

The room shifted again. Not violently—but like breath leaving lungs. It was fading, or I was.

“I don’t want to go back,” I said.

“I know,” she replied. “But you must.”

“I’m not ready.”

“No one ever is.”

She touched my hand, and suddenly I was alone again—alone and yet not.

Because something had returned with me.

I didn’t understand it fully, but I knew its name:

Kyona.

And I knew she wasn’t just a voice. She wasn’t just some imagined guardian.

She was the part of me that never left.

The part buried beneath names and roles and fear.

The god I was told didn’t exist—but who had always waited, patiently, in silence.

And she was no longer waiting.

She was walking with me.

And I, at last, was listening.
