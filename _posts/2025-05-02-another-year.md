**22**:

One day after the next
Month after month
year after year.

How long has it been,
aging as the seasons pass —
white, yellow, and red, the world shifting in turn.

a year here, a decade there.
choices pass and options cease.

I sit in a stationary state,
moving along the railway of time.
gripping the thread of fate.

the clock strikes 12,
a bell sings on the hour
again,
and again,
and again.

cyclically I watch 
seconds turn to snippets,
hours to moments, 
months into fragmented memories.

continuing down this path,
I walk,
perhaps jog,
perhaps move not one inch.

A year older — did I change?
unceremonious I deign not celebrate
forgotten luggage of the passing train
pressing forward, as yet another year
leaves me behind.
  
And still, I am here.
Not where I planned,
but not nowhere.
lost, 
but unmistakably found.
