Frauds:

Don't pretend to know what it's like to live,
If you refuse to accept life as it is.
I am sick and tired of those around me pretending, lying—to themselves—that they understand what it’s like to experience the drought of joy, the all-encompassing desensitization of life.

They pretend, to know, pretend to think, pretend to understand.  
They don’t get it, they are the problem.  
One child holds infinitely more value—  
As the child is willing to watch and learn.  
Rather than quote surface-level regurgitated thoughts.

Life is hard, ugly, and painful – to ignore that foundational truth  
Is the true heresy.
