Liminal:
Ah peace, a pretty thing,
the loveliest thing, 
a goal, a treasure, a hidden boon. 

where do I find it?
in the coldest times, 
in times of loneliness, 
of desolate times.

sound wrong? 
peculiar perhaps?
maybe so, 
but this is no lie.

Streets covered in white, 
a liminal night.
an ethereal ghost--
walks the host. 

The streets of white, 
lit to hide the night. 
the glowing moon,
changes the tune. 

peace, as I walk alone,
sublime silence,
delicate steps,
eyes on the benevolent moon.
