A Sinner's Prayer:

They told me God loved order.  
So they built temples out of fear, and altars out of rules.  
They spoke of righteousness with clenched fists,  
and measured faith by how still their pews sat.

But I looked around—  
and saw the broken ones,  
the soft-spoken heretics,  
the aching hands reaching for something they weren’t allowed to name.

I saw myself.

And I thought:  
If I am a sinner, it is not for lack of love.  
If I am lost, at least I’m walking for others.

And if God is real,  
He must be weeping at those who praise His name  
but damn His image in those they do not understand.

So no—I do not pray the loudest.  
I do not tithe the most.  
But I still believe in grace.  
And I still believe that love, not law, is what saves us in the end.
