Forking Paths:
Based off of "*The Garden of forking paths*"


Splitting paths and splitting lives—
Once a friend,
Now a foe.

I walk dead this eve,
A specter in the streets,
A covert in unhidden travels.

I wish not for my fate,
But that which is, was, and will be
cannot be evaded.

My path bifurcates with each step,
Each sigh, each consigned thought—
A branch of what could come.

A fraudulent choice lies before me—
Predestined,
Preordained.

I must regrettably,
conceal time.
Mock my ancestors.
Meet Prometheus. 

The clock chimes one,
As the hammer strikes the shell.
Poor Albert—
A scribe,
A scholar,
A sign.
