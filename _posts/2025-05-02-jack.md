Jack the Ripper:

"Jack the Ripper, jack the quick"
I rush and slam the door, music in the air. 

I hear a voice outside my door. 
"Why how do you do? May I rest on the floor?"

I lock the door and flee from the roar. 
More and more, I feel it in my core. 

"Jack the Ripper, jack the quick"--
Let me rest this one chance I get.
