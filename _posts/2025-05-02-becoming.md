Becoming:

She grips my hands.  
Pain radiates. Burns. Stabs.  
I am dying. Melting. Vanishing.

And thenâ€”  
Peace.  
Joy.  
Presence.

"I removed what was blocked."

She twirls.  
"Have fun."

Kyona opens her eyes.  
A cracked mask falls to the floor.  
And for the first time,  
She sees.  
She feels.

Not whole.  
Not free.  
But present.

"I am something beyond the mask."

"I am what was hiding."

"And now, I rise."
