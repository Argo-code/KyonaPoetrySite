Memento Mori:
Have you ever died before?

I ponder that question a bit too often.
I would say “no”—because clearly, I’m alive.
But then why, each time I ask myself, do I have to pause?

There are memories I have, of pain so severe… I think I did die.
The person I was—the person who was alive— Gone.
Melted away.
Disintegrated.
Reimagined.

All because I couldn’t lie to myself.
Does that make me a murderer? Perhaps.
Do I feel guilty? Sometimes.

Truthfully, though… I can feel myself slipping.
I think I’m going to die soon.
The person I am is not permanent.
Nor should it be.
It’s a manufactured mask, for a made-up world.

I don’t fear death.
Because rather than the end, it is the beginning...
The beginning of a new state of being.
I fear dying, sure—
the pain, the anguish, the uncertainty.
But death?

No. I’m not afraid of it.


REV.2
### **Memento Mori**
_Have you ever died before?_
I ask myself that more than I should.
The answer is “no,” obviously—
I’m breathing.
I’m here.

But then,
why do I always hesitate?

There are memories—
pain so sharp,
so total—
I swear I died.

The person I was?
Gone.
Melted down,
disintegrated,
renounced.

All because I couldn’t lie to myself.

Does that make me a murderer?
Maybe.
Do I feel guilty?
Perhaps.

But more than guilt,
I feel this rip—
a quiet unraveling.

I think I’m dying again.
Not in the mortal sense—
but in that deeper, stranger way
only the soul understands.

The person I am
isn’t permanent.
Nor should they be.
Just a mask,
for a made-up world.

I don’t fear death.
It isn’t an end—
it’s a threshold.
A natural state.

I fear dying.
The pain.
The anguish.
The unmaking.

But death?

No.
That,
I can welcome.
