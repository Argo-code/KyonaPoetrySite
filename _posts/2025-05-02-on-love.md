On Love:

Love is a sweet thing,
a pretty thing,
a graceful thing.

It is broad—
and yet, all too specific.

What can we do
when we can no longer find it?
Perhaps we love our family,
our friends,
that cute puppy.

But what of divine love?
The kind filled with mercy,
with grace.

What becomes of the soul
when its compass has no pull?
Stranded.
Lonely.

Love is love—
and yet,
we’re told we need a certain kind
to _deserve_ to live.

Love is love—
they say we exist
only by the mercy of one being.

Love is love—
but some compasses point to hell,
and still believe
they’re aimed at heaven.

Love is love—
yet inclusion becomes exclusion,
hate masquerades as mercy,
and vitriol is mistaken for grace.

This cannot be ignored—
this lovely theme,
this unreachable goal.

Love is love.
So let us not forget:
to love the neighbor,
the sick,
the hurting,
the broken,
the guilty,
the cursed.

Love is love.
So do not forget:
love is not something
to guard at the door.
