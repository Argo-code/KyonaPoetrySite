**Where Did the Sunshine Go**

walking outside brings memories—
of bright days,
happy days,
joyous days.

now,
the sun still shines—
bright enough to make me squint—
but it feels
dim.
flat.
grey.

is it joy that’s missing?
peace?
love?
comfort?

I can’t say.
but I miss the warmth,
the ease,
the way light used to feel like a hug.

now it’s just brightness.
too sharp.
too sterile.
too empty.

where did the sunshine go?
