[[Disquiet Entries]]

the simplicity of life belongs to the idiots. I envy them. Idiots come, and idiots go, and their footprints never shake. Simplicity parades as nature but hides its nuance behind costumes no one is taught to see. Can ideas ever be free, or are they always imprisoned by the very act of thought? Maybe thought itself is the shackle. We’re trained to answer and punished for asking. This world, if it can be called one, is a cruel exercise crafted for the powerful to play. And we, the rest, are asked to be thankful for the rules. Critical thought—how telling that it’s always critical, and always right, and yet never welcomed. Blessed are the blind, for they sleep soundly inside the burning church. I am not one of them. I name the fire and burn with it. I keep sacred secrets that those in comfort could not survive. For this agony is clandestine, and no one wants to hear it. That’s how I know it’s real.
