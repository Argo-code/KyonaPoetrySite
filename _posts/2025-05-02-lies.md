Lies:

How divine the lie,
the power of sound. 
to convince,
to deceive.

lies have power,
have poise and grace. 
they lay in a state of 
malevolence or benevolence

to curse or save, 
that is the power of the lie,
sprinkle in some truth, 
some spice.

the power to build,
the power to break,
responsibility's the game.

to heal others, and assuage their fears, 
or enflame the fiery hate. 
cursed are those, 
blessed are they. 

Make the right choice, 
lie when it's right, 
build through tone--
break not buttresses with cries. 

Lying has power, 
so I lie not when I say,
"keep in mind their power."
