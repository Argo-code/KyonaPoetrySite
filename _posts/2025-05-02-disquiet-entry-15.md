[[Disquiet Entries]]

I went to bed late, laying awake wishing I could dream.  
I have forgotten the life that was, and the life that could have been.  
What is there to hope? I can no longer experience the color of joy.  
dreaming while asleep? Dreaming while awake?  
I am forced to confront reality.
