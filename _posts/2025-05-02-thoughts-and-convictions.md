Thoughts, And Convictions:

Thoughts, convictions,  
Principles and ideas—  
I reach to grasp one.  
Elusive they are.

My brain is a mess, scattered—  
Fractured even.  
I can’t focus, I can’t think, I can’t decide.

But I continue.  
I can find food,  
A place to rest, a place to think.  
But I can’t control it.

My thoughts—stars in the sky.  
I reach to grasp them,  
Only to find—  
How disappointingly true—  
I’m too weak to reach.

Something whispers—  
“Reducing tension, increases strength.”

I try to let go,  
Only to find  
Myself bound to the stars,  
Eternally too far, and yet eternally chained.
