Stained Glass:
Where is the beauty in art,  
The creative soul?  
When did utility steal the light?

Glass—  
Easily shattered,  
Easily broken,  
Clear, and misty,  
Sharp, and smooth.

Where is my shattered glass—  
Built with love, joy, and wonder?  
The stained glass, reflecting the light of the world—  
Replaced.

Oh, how I miss it—  
The broken, the mistakes,  
Born again anew.
