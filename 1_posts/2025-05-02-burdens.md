**Burdens**

this burden I hold—
a strange, incalculable weight,
sharp,
jagged,
a scar more than a shape.

my life lives beyond the present,
or maybe without a past.

why does it all feel stalled,
as if I’m living a memory—
a memory of _almost_,
of potential,
of what never became?

this burden isn’t kind,
isn’t noble,
isn’t good.

it snarls,
scratches,
bites.

to let go—
impossible.
maybe fatal.
maybe worse.

a sin,
a curse,
a possession.

this weight can’t be shared.
it has no edges,
no name.

and still, I walk—
bound,
chained to it,
chained to a past I didn’t choose,
chained to a future I never asked for.

I don’t want this path anymore.
I want to rip the chains off,
start again.

but—
the chains of friends,
of family,
of society,
my own—

not so easily broken.

systemic oppression.
prewritten futures.

can I break them—
with no vision ahead?

can I break them—
with no idea what comes next?

I can’t.
it hurts.

the chains cut deeper—
into my soul,
my being,
my name.

and even in the future they offer,
even in the one I’m allowed,
I can’t say yes.

it hurts.
hurts.
hurts.

I’m being squeezed dry.
my emotions wrung out.
my thoughts sealed tight.
my voice—silent.

I whisper to myself:

questions of worth—
of life worth living.

bound in unbreakable chains,
I mourn.
