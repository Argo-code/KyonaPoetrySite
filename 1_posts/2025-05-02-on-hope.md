On Hope:
Hope is a strange thing,
a peculiar thing,
a dreamlike thing.

To hope is to have faith.
To have faith is to love.
And to love—one must have hope.
  
Hope is the gospel of life.
To live, to believe in it—
is required.

Hope, I’m told,
is belief in God existing,
a quiet dream of reality.

Some say
hope makes the impossible possible—
a hidden god, made visible.

But how can we hope
when hope has been crushed,
enflamed,
vanquished?

Hope has been stripped,
replaced,
manufactured.

Hope in the lord, is no longer hope, 
this broken faith is a torn piece of love.
and this fraudulent love is not for god. 
but for power, praise, and standing.

Why should I hope for salvation, 
when the salvation presents itself 
as everything except a choice.
