**Meeting Prometheus**:

I can feel myself crumbling—  
My body dissolving, rotting, dying.

What a strange feeling.  
Can one imagine?

The ache of dying--each breath, each glance—  
each one nearing the end?
Each haggard sigh, a resignation of fate?  
Amor fati, once believed.

But now?

I cannot respect fate,  
Until I receive respect.

Fatigue—soul crushing fatigue.  
To lift the arms, is to cry out.  
To walk is to pray it ends.

To sleep is to toy with death.  
To wake is to meet Prometheus—  
Chained to the rock of fate.
