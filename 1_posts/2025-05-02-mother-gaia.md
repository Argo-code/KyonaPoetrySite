Mother Gaia:

Where are the birds, the flowers, the fields?  
Missing. Replaced. Eroded.
Where are the trees, the fields of green,   
The warm scent of Gaia? It's gone.

It hurts. We filthy creatures decided to changeâ€”  
Not for the better, but for selfish desires.
a whisper shouts in the darkness,
"Tell them the great lord Pan, is dead"

Mother Gaia, how much sorrow I feel.  
A nostalgia for experiences I cannot grasp.  
Hidden pockets of space,
lie memories eternally forgotten

To walk a forest of green, 
fields of violet,
golden paths--
Must it evade us?

Must we, the supreme beings,  
ignore the true master of the land?
The Arbiter of Growth,
guide of storms.

Only death lies beyond:  
Death of love.  
Death of life.  
Death of joy.

Forgive us--
Mother Gaia,
For we are blind to your beauty
And now we are barred from Eden.
