Have you ever baked?  
Found the recipe, found the ingredients—  
Found the pots, the pans, the spoons, and whisks,  
Stirred, mixed, folded—  
Cut, chopped, formed,  
Put the pan in the oven, let it rest—

The recipe reads,  
I open the door—  
It's—  
Ruined, black, dry.

Why must recipes fail?  
I followed the recipe,  
Went to school, tried to learn,  
Followed God even.

No more,  
I will learn the science, the talent,  
The skill.  
I will bake my own recipe.
