[[Disquiet Entries]]
Oh woe is me, woe is this state, woe is this absurd reality. Unlike the weeping and gnashing of the public, I, only seem to understand. Understand the need for pain, suffering, and anguish. 
For what is darkness without light, danger without peace, comfort without anxiety. Those around me wish to rid themselves of the pain, rid the world of anguish and suffering. I cannot allow it, I breathe because of the pain, how else would I have found my lungs? How else would I feel my beating heart, except through heartbreak. How else can I find myself without losing myself. They don’t understand, I’m not trying to live through the pain, no. I love the pain, the present, pulsating, needling sensation. How else could I exist? What is life without pain?
