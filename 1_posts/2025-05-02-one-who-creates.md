One Who Creates:

Why should I be afraid?  
I am the one who killed the masks.

Not through action.  
But inaction.  
Isn’t that the same?

I am the owner. The creator. The subject. The ruler.  
Some call me Kyona.

I live in a wretched reality—  
unfair. unforgiving.  
But still mine.

Born male? That’s not the story.  
This isn’t tragedy.  
This isn’t pity.  
This is power.

Even if I don’t know myself—  
I can write it.  
Imagine it.  
Create it.  
Become god of it.

I’ll never be whole--
But I’ll never be chain again.

The constructs are no longer forever.

I am the alchemist.  
The tinkerer.  
The prophet.

Welcome to my story.  
Welcome to becoming.
