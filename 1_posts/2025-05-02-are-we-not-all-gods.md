Are We Not All Gods:

Are we not all gods?  
Gods of realities—  
Your reality,  
my reality?

We shift and shape,  
we change and create.

Is that not what divinity does?

To touch a thought and make it real—  
isn’t that prayer?  
Isn’t that power?

And if I can break it,  
rebuild it,  
name it,  
blame it—

am I not divine  
in the ruin I leave behind?
