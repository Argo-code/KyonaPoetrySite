### **Library of Babylon**

Based off of: "*Library of Babylon" by Borges*  
 
I can imagine an infinite recursion—
Unknowable,
Undefinable.

Some wish to organize.
Some seek answers.
Some crave the knowledge of good,
Some cry for scripture of the evil;
Others beg for life’s riddles.

The hexagonal library,
Immeasurable,
Guards and obfuscates the truth,
To dismay those who long for resolution.

How can one find what they seek,
Among the eighty letters of each line,
Each page only forty lines,
Each book a mere 410 pages,
Each shelf holding thirty-two books,
Each wall, five shelves—
And each room…
Well, we can only ask the library.

There are those searching for knowledge—
Driven mad by hunger,
Their thirst a sickness of the mind—
An incurable disease.
  
There are those searching for truth—
Their one truth,
Their only truth,
Shattered,
When their truth evades them.

There are those who seek to write—
To copy a fragment of gospel,
Heretical,
Yet oddly in control.

Herein lies the Library of Babylon:
A container of the knowable,
The unknowable,
The unfathomable,
The hidden,
The lost,
The found,
The answers.

Seek, if you must—
But heed my warning:

Peace will not come quietly.
Perhaps it won’t be found at all.
But maybe—
Just maybe—
One can find peace
In the cosmic recursion
Of this blessed library.
