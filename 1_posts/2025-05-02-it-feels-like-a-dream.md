It Feels Like a Dream:

It feels like a dream,  
A cup of cocoa, a warm fire—  
A nice blanket,  
A good book, a comfy couch.

I bleakly look back,  
My memories hazy, dreamlike.  
Did I dream it?

I can feel the warmth,  
But no longer can I remember.

Where is my comfort,  
Where is the warmth,  
The safety—security—  
Where is it?  
Was it just a dream?
