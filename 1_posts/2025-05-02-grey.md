Grey:

Grey.  
Grey, Grey, Grey.  
The world of colors, colors I know exist,  
Wish for, hope for, dream for—  
Gone, covered up, washed out.

All I see is grey.  
The presence of color is missing.  
The potent, awe-inspiring, beautiful color,  
Forgotten, painted over—

These broad strokes cover the joy,  
The happiness, the emotion of the landscape.  
And what does that leave me?  
Grey.
