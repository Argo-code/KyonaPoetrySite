Karmatically Ordained:

I’m not quite alive,  
nor quite dead.  
Not a myth, not a legend.

Why do I feel so inhuman?  
The joy, sorrow, satisfaction—  
But alas, I can’t experience it.

I am a vampire, without the fangs.  
A basilisk without eyes.  
A god without knowledge.  
A mythological being, without the guise.

Does that make me less than human?  
Adjacent?
Broken, or Burdened?
A forgotten tale?

What must one do to experience these feelings,  
So beautiful, so sacred?  
Perhaps I am just a muzzled beast,  
Unable to drink the ambrosia of life.

I pretend I’m joking, pretend I’m aloof—  
How quaint.  
How could I pretend to be something  
If the opposite wasn’t known?

I unfortunately know all too well what I lack.  
What I have hoarded in silence.

I breathe an anxious breath, 
not because I am anxious,  
But because that is who I am.  
I sigh dejectedly, 
not because I am dejected,  
But because that is innately who I am.

I mirror the smiles I see around me,  
But the smile doesn’t reach my eyes.  
My soul yearns for peace—  
That self-destructive peace.

Alas—who would I be?  
Who would I be without my inner world,
my spectacular failings?
A siren without a voice?  
A hero without a quest?

I am shaped--
brick by brick--
in the forge of feeling,
raw, primal, unjust.
*Amor Fati:*
not a mercy,
but a sacred fate.

But judge not the arsonist—  
Without considering
the flame from which they came.
Judge not the prophet--
before hearing their sermon
Judge not the strong--
without knowing what made them so. 

I am not quite a beast, 
not quite a God, 
but something stranger still, 
an ancient being born of fire,
unquenchable--
still aflame.
