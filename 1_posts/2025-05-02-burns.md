Burns:
the burning soul,
the burning mind—

my body on fire,
my soul aflame.

eyes dry,
heavy, drooping.

I wait—
passive—
for life
to take the reins.

to hold on
is to let go.

**wu wei:**
non-action
as action—

but this?
this is avoiding,
not acting.

I am lost.
Stranded.
Afraid.

my body:
a dungeon,
a maze.

am I me—
or just it?

scattered thoughts
flit across a dim sky.
inside,
a tangle of stories,
myths,
ideals.

the god within
weeps
for what even they
cannot escape.

oh—
what a burning pain.
