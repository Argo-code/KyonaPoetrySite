[[Disquiet Entries]]

Oh, how wondrous is faith. I envy it like one envies sleep. I ponder the faith of leaders, of prophets, of the public who still manages to believe in truth as if it were handed to them pre-wrapped. But what else is faith, if not crass hope in hiding from the truth? I could say I have faith in humanity. I won’t. Lies dissolve in my corrosive mind before they form. And yet, imagine—just imagine—what it would be like to trust. To accept the world as told. To believe in the future because someone on television said it would be okay. Wouldn’t that be easy? No. No, I’d be lying again. It sounds nice, and yet it sounds like anesthesia like numbness. Ineptitude breeds chaos. Chaos breeds division. And division ruins my morning tea. I say I want to escape the fear, the politics, the social war—but I don’t. I love it. I thrive on it. It wakes me. It sharpens the knife of my mind. Perhaps that’s all I am: a creature carved awake by the absurdity of others’ hope.
