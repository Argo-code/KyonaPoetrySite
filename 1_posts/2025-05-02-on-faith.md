On Faith:

Oh how omnipotent, how divine.  
The lord sitting in the heavens,  
Ruler of the stars,  
Caretaker of destiny.

How benevolent and kind,  
Merciful, and true.  
Who reaches to those in the depths,  
Hand outstretched—

What a sick joke, a divine comedy.  
A god of miracles, a god of truth,  
A god of love, a god of goodness.  

A bloodstained hill, 
a man hung on the mount, 
goodness has fled. Love has shriveled.

“God is dead.”  
Perhaps we killed him, perhaps not.  
Perhaps this god was never divine.  
Perhaps human yearning’s greatest creation.

A God of hope, now a God for salvation.  
The true meaning of God has been stolen.  
And the thieves shroud their guilt with grief.

My soul is burning. That which was known—  
Now, just an empty space.

Heed this:
Put not your life into a god,  
Without first, trying to become a god.
And when you have ascended, 
maybe, perhaps maybe--
You can find the loving God again.
